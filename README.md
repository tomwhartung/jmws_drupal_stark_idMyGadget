# jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d7

Code to integrate idMyGadget [(in the jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d7 repo)](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_idMyGadget_for_drupal-d7) with the default Drupal 7 theme Stark.

# This Project Is on Hold Indefinitely

Work on this project is on hold indefinitely for the following reasons:

1. The version of jQuery that Drupal 7 uses is incompatible with the version of jQuery Mobile that we want to use

1. Drupal 8 has been released

Therefore all work on this project is currently being done in the [jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8 repo](https://github.com/tomwhartung/jmws_drupal_stark_idMyGadget-d8).

Thank you for your understanding.

# For possible future reference:

### html.tpl.php

* Changed doctype to html

* Added theme name to title (TODO: REMOVE THIS)
